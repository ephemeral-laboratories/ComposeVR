Compose VR
----------

Prototype of rendering a Compose Multiplatform window as a
Steam VR overlay.

Works by integrating Compose's experimental support for
integrating with LWJGL with OpenVR.

What works:
* You can show an overlay window
* You can probably make it transparent by painting
  transparent as the background colour for the surface,
  but I haven't tried

What doesn't work:
* You can't interact with any of the UI
* Pretty much everything else doesn't work XD
